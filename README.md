# Medical-Imaging-and-Diagnostics-3D-MRI-and-CT-Scans.-
Objectiveof this project is Analyze 3D medical images to detect anomalies, segment organs, 
and assist in diagnosing diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and 
neurological disorders based on deep learning approaches. Currently i am working on gathering information and doing research about topic, soon i will start uploiding deep learning based models and modifications. As a framework I am using Pytorch. Stay tuned!
